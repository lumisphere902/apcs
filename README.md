A few of the projects I wrote during the AP Computer Science class I took.

P1_Poon_Timothy_DrawingTool - A class which uses mouse inputs to allow two players to play Tic Tac Toe locally; uses gpdraw for rendering

P1_Poon_Timothy_MyFractal - Draws the Hemingway Dragon fractal; uses gpdraw for rendering

P1_Poon_Timothy_StringCraft - A console game where players swap indices to create greater or equal scores, until there are no more valid moves. A function to find the best possible way to play with a specific string is also included. The score of a string is determined in this way:
Each letter is worth 1 point by default.
A letter is worth 2 more points than the previous letter if they are equal.
A letter is worth 1 more point than the previous letter if the ASCII value is subsequent.

P1_Poon_Timothy_Layout - A basic game using JavaFX where users try to manage an animal's stats.

SpiderSolitaire - A console implementation of Spider Solitaire.
